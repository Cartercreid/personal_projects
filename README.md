# personal_projects
Some of Carter's personal projects.

Important note! Some projects may be WIP

This repo is intended to be a location for me to post my personal projects so that others may view some of my coding work.
Some of the code and projects in here were written early in my education, and therefore do not have the best coding practices associated with them. I am currently trying to go back and refactor/improve some of these projects, but that too is a work in progress.

Some of these projects may benefit current students, though I have removed most of the specific assignemnts other than sorting algorithms, which can be found elsewhere on the internet anyway.

If you are currently a student, and looking at this repositoy, please do the intelligent thing, and do not copy any code into your school projects as this may result in an honor code violation with your institution of education.

Employer's looking at this material: I encourage you to check out the RNA_sequencing project, as I am most proud of that.
Thanks for showing interest in my work!

Sincerely,
-Carter
