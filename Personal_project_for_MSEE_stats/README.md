This is a personal project that I wrote for my wife.

 One part of her job is to go through a CSV file of potential students and report numbers by country, and areas of interest among other thins. Initially when the CSV was small, manual counting was acceptable, but it became clear that over time, manual counting would become more and more problematic, so I wrote a simple python script for her that she can run on her own, to automate the process.

I redacted any personal information from the two csv files in this folder, as it's irrelevent to the functioning of the program, and posting names/emails online without permission is widely regarded as a dick move.

There were many tools that I could have used for a simple restructuring of the data, SQL being one that I contemplated using, but I ended up using python with the Pandas module.

Overall, this is just a fun personal project that I coded for my wife in an afternoon.
