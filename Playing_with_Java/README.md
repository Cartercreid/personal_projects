This folder definitly falls under the 'Work in Progress' category.

None of the classes I took covered Java. Some went over certain aspects of it i.e. garbage collection, object orientation, jvm, etc...

This repo really is just a convenient place for me to keep my "learning java" files, which so far are simple things, like building a class, using random numbers, learning the syntax of for loops and if statements, and printing things.

I am writing these projects in intelliJ, and they are included here to demonstrate my interest in learning both a new language and also becoming a better intelliJ user.

If you have any ideas for a cool project that I can build in Java that will challenge me to learn this language more effectively, please email me at: carter.c.reid@gmail.com
